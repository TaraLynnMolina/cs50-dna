# cs50-dna
A Python program that identifies individuals by analyzing DNA sequences based on short tandem repeats (STRs). Built as part of CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University).

ðŸ“– Overview

The program takes as input:
	1.	A CSV database containing individualsâ€™ names and their STR counts.
	2.	A DNA sequence file containing an unknown DNA string.

It then:
	â€¢	Counts the longest consecutive runs of each STR in the DNA sequence.
	â€¢	Compares those counts against the database.
	â€¢	Identifies the individual if there is an exact match, otherwise reports No match.

Example: python dna.py databases/large.csv sequences/5.txt
â†’ Output: Lavender

ðŸ›  Features
	â€¢	Implements DNA profiling using STR pattern matching.
	â€¢	Works with both small and large DNA databases.
	â€¢	Uses Python string manipulation for sequence analysis.

ðŸš€ How to Run
	1.	Run the program with a database file and DNA sequence file: python dna.py database.csv sequence.txt 
  2.	The program outputs the name of the matching individual, or No match.
